I&rsquo;m using Softr as the no-code tool for the front end, and it&rsquo;s somewhat simple in how/what it can display. It took a little while figuring out what I can do on the Softr side vs what I need to do in Airtable. I&rsquo;ve taken the tact of trying to get everything I need to display in Softr into a single table in Airtable. I think Airtable is able to manage more complex relationships, and it makes it simpler to simply display whats needed in Softr.</p>\n",
