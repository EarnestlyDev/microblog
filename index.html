			 <p>Days 23-27/30: I&rsquo;ve had a bit of a slow spot in this 30 day challenge - just too many other things going on. Regardless &hellip;</p>
<p>I was able to do a little debugging of the issue between Make and Shippo and open a ticket with Shippo after verifying the API request/response from Make. Turns out there&rsquo;s a bug in the API, they suggested an alternate endpoint as a workaround (the one I was using is still in beta).</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;m just about at the point of making a final punchlist before calling this ready.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Day 22/30: Tonight was about getting an integration from Airtable to Shippo via Make. I&rsquo;ve got all of the correct fields from Airtable now, but am having some issues with Shippo not wanting to use the sender address. Not sure if it&rsquo;s a Make issue or a Shippo issue.</p>

			 <p>Day 21/30: After stepping back and thinking through what data I need where, I&rsquo;ve untangled the mess I made in Airtable. The Softr UI is wired back up to everything correctly, and I believe I&rsquo;ve got all of the individual fields that I need for Shippo.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Day 20/30: it&rsquo;s possible that I&rsquo;ve overcomplicated the schema in my Airtable. I think I&rsquo;ve undone a few degrees of complexity - still need to rethink what that means for what I can use on Softr.</p>
<p>I mostly like no-code, but sometimes it seems like it&rsquo;d be easier if I wasn&rsquo;t bound by its constraints.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Days 17-19/30: the weekend got away from me a bit. Over the past few days I realized the way I was storing addresses (in a single field) won&rsquo;t work for the Shippo API (obvious in hindsight). I&rsquo;ve been doing a little work in Airtable to fix this which has trickled into some updates in Softr.</p>

			 <p>Day 14/30: With the core functionality on the website done I&rsquo;ve turned my attention to some of the other backend processes - specifically shipping and transactional emails. I&rsquo;ll write some more in a few days after I&rsquo;ve settled on an initial plan.</p>

			 <p>Day 13/30: Got an earlier start today instead of cramming some work in at the end of the day üí™üèº. I&rsquo;ve got all of the data bits wired into the UI. I&rsquo;m sure that I&rsquo;ll make some small tweaks later but the core functionality is there so I&rsquo;m moving onto shipping labels.</p>

			 <p>Day 11/30 &amp; 12/30: Getting closer on the functionality to allow logged in users track their exchanges. I&rsquo;m using Softr as the no-code tool for the front end, and it&rsquo;s somewhat simple in how/what it can display. It took a little while figuring out what I can do on the Softr side vs what I need to do in Airtable. I&rsquo;ve taken the tact of trying to get everything I need to display in Softr into a single table in Airtable. I think Airtable is able to manage more complex relationships, and it makes it simpler to simply display whats needed in Softr.</p>

			 <p>Day 10/30: Almost (?) done with the refactoring to support user accounts. All of the login flows are done, but I still need to sort out some details with what users can see/do after they&rsquo;ve registered for a coffee exchange.</p>

			 <p>Day 8/30: I made a <em>tiny</em> bit of progress on the refactor to enable users to create an account at signup.
Day 9/30: I&rsquo;ve made some more significant progress on this refactor. I think the Airtable updates have been all made, but now I&rsquo;m working through updates on the Softr side.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Day 7/30: I decided I do want to have users create an account when they signup. This will enable an easy way for them to be able to view the status of their exchange - so is worth the slight complexity and time of redoing a few things with my Airtable schema.</p>

			 <p>Day 6/30: finished up the integration from Airtable to MailerLite w/Make - pretty smooth going (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be some small tweaks I&rsquo;ll make b/f going live). I&rsquo;ve been reconsidering whether I want to create user accounts when people sign up (vs just emailing them transaction details). ü§î</p>

			 <p>Day 2/30: more updates to the ROAST NOTES landing page ‚Äì¬†it&rsquo;s about ready to go.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I pivoted from the original idea for RN. I liked what I&rsquo;d built, but wasn&rsquo;t convinced it was something I&rsquo;d use or pay for.</p>
<p>The new idea: a simple way to exchange my roasts with other home roasters.</p>
