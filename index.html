			 <p>Day 11/30 &amp; 12/30: Getting closer on the functionality to allow logged in users track their exchanges. I&rsquo;m using Softr as the no-code tool for the front end, and it&rsquo;s somewhat simple in how/what it can display. It took a little while figuring out what I can do on the Softr side vs what I need to do in Airtable. I&rsquo;ve taken the tact of trying to get everything I need to display in Softr into a single table in Airtable. I think Airtable is able to manage more complex relationships, and it makes it simpler to simply display whats needed in Softr.</p>

			 <p>Day 10/30: Almost (?) done with the refactoring to support user accounts. All of the login flows are done, but I still need to sort out some details with what users can see/do after they&rsquo;ve registered for a coffee exchange.</p>

			 <p>Day 8/30: I made a <em>tiny</em> bit of progress on the refactor to enable users to create an account at signup.
Day 9/30: I&rsquo;ve made some more significant progress on this refactor. I think the Airtable updates have been all made, but now I&rsquo;m working through updates on the Softr side.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Day 7/30: I decided I do want to have users create an account when they signup. This will enable an easy way for them to be able to view the status of their exchange - so is worth the slight complexity and time of redoing a few things with my Airtable schema.</p>

			 <p>Day 6/30: finished up the integration from Airtable to MailerLite w/Make - pretty smooth going (I&rsquo;m sure there&rsquo;ll be some small tweaks I&rsquo;ll make b/f going live). I&rsquo;ve been reconsidering whether I want to create user accounts when people sign up (vs just emailing them transaction details). ðŸ¤”</p>

			 <p>Day 2/30: more updates to the ROAST NOTES landing page â€“Â it&rsquo;s about ready to go.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago I pivoted from the original idea for RN. I liked what I&rsquo;d built, but wasn&rsquo;t convinced it was something I&rsquo;d use or pay for.</p>
<p>The new idea: a simple way to exchange my roasts with other home roasters.</p>
